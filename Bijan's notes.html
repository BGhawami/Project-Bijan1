		What a web page is?
	  </div>	
	  <div class="concept-description">
	    <p>	
	      A web page is a text document written  in a language called <span class="italic"> HTML</span> Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
	    </p>   
        <p> 
          How coding works: Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
        </p>
        <p>
          Computers are stupid. Therefore write with the correct <span class="italic">syntax</span>!
        </p> 
        <p>
          Programmers can't remember everything - that is okay; you need to know where to look it up

          Tags and elements
        </div>   
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>	
          HTML documents are made of HTML 
          <span class="bold">elements</span>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML 
          <span class="bold">tags</span> 
          An HTML tag is always contained within <em>angled</em> brackets. Most tag have an opening tag and a closing tag.ELEMENT = An HTML element refers to every thing within a set of opening and closing tags.ATTRIBUTE = This is a property of an HTML element. For example to set the href attribute of an anchor tag.

        Why Computers are Stupid
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret 
          instructions literally. This makes them very 
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a 
          programmer can cause huge problems in a program.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form 
          an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

          Structure of a page HTML - <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> - the structured markup language to create webpages. CSS - <em>Cascading style shetts</em> - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document within an markup language.DOM -<em>Document Object Model</em> - a cross platform and language independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML and other markup languages.The nodes of every document are organzised in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a programmers perspective, everything on a page is a box; "boxify a page". The weblayout is scetched out in boxes

          HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> 
          or <span class="bold">block</span>. Block elements form

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML 
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can 
          draw this relationship like a family tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series 
          of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes 
          inside of boxes, and so on...

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as 
          <span class="italic">text</span>, you see a wave of 
          changing indentations going up and down the left side 
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the 
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors 
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the 
          programmer's life easier.

          Styling and CSS
        </div>
					<div class="content-description">
            <p>
					              Search think about CSS as search and replace tool, identify a class, id or tag of the element you want ot find and then replace with properties, values you want.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Order in CSS matters: define rules in the order you want them applied</li>
						
								<li>Default style of a browser</li>
								<li>Apply styles through a seperate linked css file- Best method to work with.</li>
								<li>Creating your styles within the HTML document, not regularly used, in practice works with small projects that don't require extensive changes and styling.</li>
								<li>Inline styling within the individual element, not effective or efficient as it will cause repetition which is what programing tries to avoid.</li>
            </ul>
    <p>
						Specifics or specificity matters - "Cascading" means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all those elements child elements. However; if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect.
  </p>
      <p>
            All webpages are built with the box model in mind, breaking all the individual elements into boxes, in order to better organize the structure of the page.

					Steps of the web programmer:
   </div>
     <div class="content-description">
					<ol>
						<li>Look for natural boxes</li>
						<li>look for repeated styles & semantic elements.</li>
						<li>Write your HTML</li>
						<li>Apply Styles (from the biggest to the smallest - remember specificity</li>
						<li>Tweak and fix as you repeat steps 3 - and 4</li>
					</ol>
